#  Written by Katherine (Hudson) Gallagher
#  OVERVIEW: This function is written to calculate two connectivity metrics between different predefined regions using particle trajectories from the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The two metrics are:
        #1 - the proportion of particles released in region A interact with all other regions (including region A [which should be equal to 1 as a sanity check])
        #2 - the amount of time particles released in region A spend in all other regions (including region A)

#   INPUT = matrices with lat/lon positions of particles from ROMS output, list of regions where each component of the list is a 2 column matrix with lon/lat coordinates of region boundary, list of indices of particles that start in each regions
#   OUTPUT = 2 lists of results from both metrics (see below)

connectivity <- function(starts, boxes, lon, lat, run, nRelease){
    #starts - a list with the same length as boxes that includes indexes used to subset particle position matrices
    #boxes - list of regions where each component of the list is a 2 column matrix with lon/lat coordinates of region boundary
    #lon & lat = matrices of particle positions from ROMS. *Note: latitude and longitude are in 2 seperate matrices where rows = number of particles and columns = number of particle positions saved (aka timestep). Matrices are structured such that row 1 is the position of simulated krill 1 released at release event #1 Row 2 is the position of simulated krill 1 released at release event #2, and so on. There were a total of 16 release events in these simulations, therefore, row 17 is the position of simulated krill 2 released at release event #1. 
    #run - a unique identifier associated with the model run of the particles used for saving the results (a character vector)
    #nRelease = total number of releases in model run
